# Donation Policy

Thank you for considering donating a dataset to the UCI Machine Learning Repository!
Through donating a dataset, you are helping keep machine learning a strong and vital
research area.

### Before donating a dataset, please read the IMPORTANT information below:

1. You must have explicit permission to make the dataset publicly available. If you are
   not the original dataset collector, the original dataset collector should be aware that
   you are donating the dataset to UCI and provide their consent.

2. If your dataset contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII), this information
   should be removed prior to donation, such that no individuals can be identified through
   your dataset.

3. Datasets approved to be in the repository will be assigned a Digital Object
   Identifier (DOI) if they do not already possess one. DOIs allow for “persistent and
   actionable identification” of datasets, which is an important component of reproducible
   research. For more information on DOIs, please read more in the [DOI Handbook](https://www.doi.org/hb.html)

4. Datasets will be licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
   license (CC BY 4.0) which allows for the sharing and adaptation of the datasets for any
   purpose, provided that the appropriate credit is given (see Citation Policy). For more
   information on the CC BY 4.0 license, please read more in the
